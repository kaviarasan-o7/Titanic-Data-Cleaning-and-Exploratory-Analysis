# Titanic Dataset Analysis

An exploratory data analysis and data cleaning project on the famous Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview

This project performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival rates. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization of key factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of the Titanic dataset
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful information
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Statistical summary of key findings
- PDF report generation with all visualizations

## Dataset

The analysis uses the classic Titanic dataset which contains information about passengers including:
- Demographic information (age, sex, class)
- Ticket information
- Cabin information
- Family relationships
- Survival status

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals several factors that significantly influenced survival rates:

- Gender played a crucial role in survival, with females having a much higher survival rate than males
- Passenger class strongly correlated with survival chances, with higher classes having better odds
- Age distribution shows interesting patterns related to survival
- Family size had an impact on survival probability

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook/Python scripts for analysis
